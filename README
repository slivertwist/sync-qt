UNTESTED!!! Please do not use until further notice.

This client has been untested with the latest ownCloud. I will be updating

3a) Using QtCreator

Open owncloud_sync.pro with QtCreator. Then navigate to the Projects tab.
Select Build Settings. Expand the qmake section (under build steps). If you want
to enable the use of KWallet add "DEFINES += OCS_USE_KWALLET" under additional
arguments (keep the quotes).

If you had compiled ownCloud Sync Qt before, it is a good idea to run qmake
again and do a clean all:

Click on owncloud_sync folder in the Projects view pane. Select run qmake.
Then go to Build in the menu, and select Clean All.

Then build and run :)
